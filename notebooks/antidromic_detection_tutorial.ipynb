    "# Introduction to Antidromic Stimulation\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem: Classifying Neurons by Their Projection Targets\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding brain function requires knowing not just *where* neurons are located, but *where they send their outputs*. In motor cortex, for example, some neurons project directly to the spinal cord to control movement (pyramidal tract neurons, PTNs), while others project to the basal ganglia to coordinate motor planning (corticostriatal neurons, CSNs). These cell types have distinct physiological properties and are differentially affected by neurological diseases like Parkinson's disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here's the challenge: when you insert a recording electrode into motor cortex, you can only \"see\" the neuron's cell body and nearby processes. How do you determine where that neuron's axon goes - potentially tens of millimeters away?\n",
    "\n",
    "Several methods exist for neuron classification:\n",
    "- **Anatomical tracing**: Inject tracers at target sites; neurons that project there become labeled\n",
    "- **Optogenetics**: Express light-sensitive proteins in specific projection classes\n",
    "- **Antidromic stimulation**: Stimulate at potential target sites and look for characteristic responses\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial focuses on **antidromic stimulation**, the classical electrophysiological approach used extensively in primate neurophysiology.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Orthodromic vs Antidromic: The Direction of Action Potentials\n",
    "\n",
    "Under normal physiological conditions, action potentials travel **orthodromically** - from the cell body (soma), down the axon, to the synaptic terminals at distant targets. This is the \"forward\" direction that carries information from the neuron to its downstream partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, axons can conduct action potentials in either direction. If you artificially initiate an action potential at the axon terminal (by electrical stimulation), it will travel **antidromically** - backwards up the axon toward the cell body. When this antidromic spike reaches the soma, it can be detected by a recording electrode positioned there.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Orthodromic (normal physiology):     Cell Body ---> Axon ---> Target\n",
    "Antidromic (experimental):           Cell Body <--- Axon <--- [STIM]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This bidirectionality is the key insight: if you stimulate at a particular brain region and a recorded neuron responds antidromically, you know that neuron's axon passes through (or terminates in) that region."

    "## A Specific Example: The Turner Lab Parkinson's Disease Study\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate antidromic stimulation with real data, we will use recordings from a study by Pasquereau & Turner (2011, *Cerebral Cortex* 21:1362-1378). This research used antidromic identification to compare the activity of pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) and corticostriatal neurons (CSNs) in monkeys before and after inducing parkinsonism with MPTP. By separating these cell types, the researchers discovered that Parkinson's disease pathology selectively affects PTNs while relatively sparing CSNs - a finding that would have been impossible without projection-based classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anatomical Context: M1, Cerebral Peduncle, and Striatum\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Pasquereau & Turner study, recordings were made from **primary motor cortex (M1)** - the region of cortex most directly involved in generating voluntary movement commands. M1 contains multiple types of projection neurons, but two major classes were of interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pyramidal Tract Neurons (PTNs)\n",
    "- **Location in cortex**: Layer 5b of M1 (deep layer, large pyramidal cells)\n",
    "- **Projection target**: Spinal cord, via the corticospinal (pyramidal) tract\n",
    "- **Axon pathway**: Axons descend through the corona radiata, enter the internal capsule, and converge in the **cerebral peduncle** - a massive white matter bundle at the base of the midbrain that carries all descending cortical motor commands\n",
    "- **Function**: Direct control of spinal motor neurons and interneurons; execution of fine, skilled movements\n",
    "- **Stimulation site for identification**: Cerebral peduncle (where PTN axons are densely bundled together)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Corticostriatal Neurons (CSNs)\n",
    "- **Location in cortex**: Layer 5 of M1 (intratelencephalic type)\n",
    "- **Projection target**: Striatum (specifically the putamen, the motor division of the basal ganglia)\n",
    "- **Axon pathway**: Axons project to the ipsilateral **posterolateral putamen**, which receives topographically organized inputs from motor cortices\n",
    "- **Function**: Provide cortical information to basal ganglia circuits involved in action selection, motor learning, and movement vigor\n",
    "- **Stimulation site for identification**: Posterolateral putamen (striatum)\n",
    "\n",
    "By placing stimulating electrodes in both the cerebral peduncle and the putamen, researchers can determine which neurons are PTNs (respond to peduncle stimulation), which are CSNs (respond to putamen stimulation), and which are neither or both."

    "### Understanding What We See\n",
    "\n",
    "**That's it.** That's an antidromic response. The method is conceptually simple:\n",
    "1. Stimulate at a potential axon target (here, the striatum)\n",
    "2. Record at the cell body (here, motor cortex)\n",
    "3. If the neuron's axon passes through the stimulation site, you see a response\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top panel - Neural Response:**\n",
    "- At **t = 0 ms** (red dashed line): A large, sharp deflection called the **stimulation artifact**. This is electrical contamination from the stimulation pulse - NOT neural activity.\n",
    "- At **t = 6.4 ms** (green dotted line): A smaller but distinct waveform - the **antidromic spike**. This is the action potential that traveled backwards up the axon from the striatum to the motor cortex cell body.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bottom panel - Stimulation Current:**\n",
    "- The **biphasic waveform** shows the current delivered: first positive, then negative (or vice versa)\n",
    "- This charge-balanced pulse minimizes tissue damage during repeated stimulation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Latency?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **latency** is the time between the stimulation and the arrival of the antidromic spike at the cell body. Here, it's 6.4 ms.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Latency = Distance / Conduction Velocity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This latency reflects:\n",
    "- **Distance**: How far the action potential must travel (striatum to motor cortex)\n",
    "- **Conduction velocity**: How fast action potentials propagate along this axon\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Latency and Cell Type Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Different neuron types have different latencies because they have different axon properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Cell Type | Stimulation Site | Typical Latency | Why |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----|\n",
    "| **PTN** | Cerebral peduncle | 0.6-2.5 ms | Large, heavily myelinated axons = fast conduction |\n",
    "| **CSN** | Striatum | 2-20 ms | Smaller axons = slower conduction |\n",
    "\n",

    "## Why Do We Need Validation?\n",
    "\n",
    "The sweep above looks convincing - there's clearly a response at a consistent latency after stimulation. But how do we **know** this is an antidromic response?\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that electrical stimulation can activate neurons through multiple pathways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Antidromic** (what we want): The stimulus directly activates the recorded neuron's axon, and the spike travels backward to the cell body\n",
    "2. **Synaptic/Orthodromic** (confounding): The stimulus activates other neurons at the stimulation site, which then synaptically excite the recorded neuron through a forward pathway\n",
    "\n",
    "Both would produce a spike after stimulation. We need rigorous criteria to distinguish them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Three Criteria for Antidromic Activation\n",
    "\n",
    "The electrophysiology literature has established three standard criteria for confirming antidromic activation (Fuller & Schlag, 1976, *Brain Research* 112:283-298):\n",
    "\n",
    "| Criterion | Test | Why It Works |\n",
    "|-----------|------|-------------|\n",
    "| **Fixed latency** | Response occurs at constant delay across trials | Axon conduction time is invariant; synaptic delays fluctuate |\n",
    "| **Frequency following** | Neuron follows stimulation at >200 Hz | Axons can fire rapidly; synapses fatigue at high frequencies |\n",
    "| **Collision test** | Spontaneous spike blocks the antidromic response | Two action potentials annihilate when they meet on the same axon |\n",
    "\n",
    "The **collision test** is the gold standard because it's the most definitive - it can only happen if the orthodromic and antidromic spikes are traveling on the same axon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate each criterion with real data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Criterion 1: Fixed Latency\n",
    "\n",
    "The first criterion tests whether the response latency is constant across trials. Axon conduction time is determined by physical properties (axon length and conduction velocity) that don't change from trial to trial. Synaptic transmission, in contrast, is probabilistic and introduces variable delays.\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Critical Collision Window\n",
    "\n",
    "For collision to occur, the spontaneous spike must be traveling down the axon when the antidromic spike is traveling up. This defines a **critical window** before stimulation:\n",
