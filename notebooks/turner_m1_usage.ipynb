The data investigates motor encoding deficits in MPTP-induced parkinsonism, comparing pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) versus corticostriatal neurons (CSNs).\n",

    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **Single-unit recordings**: Spike times and waveforms from M1 neurons\n",
    "- **Motor behavior**: Flexion/extension task with analog kinematics\n",
    "- **Cell type identification**: Antidromic stimulation to classify PTNs vs CSNs\n",
    "- **Disease model**: MPTP-treated parkinsonian macaque monkeys\n",
    "- **Electrode mapping**: Systematic cortical penetrations with stereotactic coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Organization:**\n",
    "- Each NWB file represents one recording session from one penetration depth\n",
