  experiment_description: |
    This dataset contains recordings of single-unit activity from ventrolateral anterior nucleus (VLa) and motor cortex region (M1-S, M1-G) in MPTP treated monkeys performing a choice reaction time reaching task.
    The neuronal activity was recorded using 16-contact linear probes (0.5–1.0 MΩ, V-probe, Plexon).
    The neuronal data were amplified (4×, 2 Hz–7.5 kHz) and digitized at 24 kHz (16-bit resolution; Tucker Davis Technologies).
    The neuronal data were high-pass filtered (Fpass: 200 Hz, Matlab FIRPM) and thresholded, and candidate action potentials were sorted into clusters in principal components space (Off-line Sorter, Plexon).
    Some sessions also included stimulation of GPi using custom built stimulating electrodes implanted in the arm-related region of primary motor cortex and in the SCP at its decussation.
  session_description: |
    This session contains raw and high-pass filtered (200 Hz) extracellular data from the ventrolateral anterior nucleus (VLa) and motor cortex region (M1-S, M1-G) recorded in MPTP treated monkeys performing a choice reaction time reaching task.
    The neuronal activity was recorded using 16-contact linear probes (0.5–1.0 MΩ, V-probe, Plexon).
    Spike sorting was performed on the high-pass filtered data using the offline sorter Plexon.
