  experiment_description: |
    This dataset contains recordings of single-unit activity from globus pallidus-internus (GPi) in MPTP treated monkeys performing a choice reaction time reaching task.
    The neuronal activity was recorded using 16-contact linear probes (0.5–1.0 MΩ, V-probe, Plexon), amplified (4×, 2 Hz–7.5 kHz) and digitized at 24 kHz (16-bit resolution; Tucker Davis Technologies).
    During a subset of data collection sessions, electromyography (EMG) data was collected.
    The EMG signals were amplified (4×), band-pass filtered (100–5,000 Hz), digitized (6,104 Hz), rectified, low-pass filtered (500 Hz), and then down-sampled to 1,017 Hz.
    The neuronal data were high-pass filtered (Fpass: 200 Hz, Matlab FIRPM) and thresholded, and candidate action potentials were sorted into clusters in principal components space (Off-line Sorter, Plexon).
  session_description: |
    This session contains raw and high-pass filtered (200 Hz) extracellular data from the globus pallidus-internus (GPi) recorded in MPTP treated monkeys performing a choice reaction time reaching task.
    The neuronal activity was recorded using 16-contact linear probes (0.5–1.0 MΩ, V-probe, Plexon). Some sessions may also contain electromyography (EMG) data.
    Spike sorting was performed on the high-pass filtered data using the offline sorter Plexon.
