  experiment_description: |
    This dataset contains recordings of single-unit activity from globus pallidus-internus (GPi) and ventrolateral anterior nucleus (VLa) in MPTP treated monkeys performing a choice reaction time reaching task.
    The neuronal activity was recorded using 16-contact linear probes (0.5–1.0 MΩ, V-probe, Plexon) and glass-insulated tungsten microelectrodes (0.5–1.5 MΩ, Alpha Omega) with at least one electrode positioned in each of GPi and VLa.
    The neuronal data were amplified (4×, 2 Hz–7.5 kHz) and digitized at 24 kHz (16-bit resolution; Tucker Davis Technologies).
    During a subset of data collection sessions, electromyography (EMG) data was collected.
    The EMG signals were amplified (4×), band-pass filtered (100–5,000 Hz), digitized (6,104 Hz), rectified, low-pass filtered (500 Hz), and then down-sampled to 1,017 Hz.
    The neuronal data were high-pass filtered (Fpass: 200 Hz, Matlab FIRPM) and thresholded, and candidate action potentials were sorted into clusters in principal components space (Off-line Sorter, Plexon).
    Some sessions also included stimulation of GPi using custom built stimulating electrodes implanted in the arm-related region of primary motor cortex and in the SCP at its decussation.
  session_description: |
    This session contains raw and high-pass filtered (200 Hz) extracellular data from the globus pallidus-internus (GPi) and ventrolateral anterior nucleus (VLa) recorded in MPTP treated monkeys performing a choice reaction time reaching task.
    The neuronal activity was recorded using 16-contact linear probes (0.5–1.0 MΩ, V-probe, Plexon) and glass-insulated tungsten microelectrodes (0.5–1.5 MΩ, Alpha Omega) with at least one electrode positioned in each of GPi and VLa.
    Some sessions may also contain electromyography (EMG) data.
    Spike sorting was performed on the high-pass filtered data using the offline sorter Plexon.
