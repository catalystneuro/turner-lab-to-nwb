  experiment_description: |
    This dataset contains recordings of single-unit activity from globus pallidus-internus (GPi) in MPTP
    (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-induced monkeys performing a choice reaction time reaching task.
    The neuronal activity was recorded using 16-contact linear probes (0.5–1.0 MΩ, V-probe, Plexon) or glass-insulated
    tungsten microelectrodes (0.5–1.5 MΩ, Alpha Omega). The neuronal data were amplified (4×, 2 Hz–7.5 kHz) and
    digitized at 24.414 kHz (approx., 16-bit resolution; Tucker Davis Technologies).
    The neuronal data were high-pass filtered (Fpass: 200 Hz, Matlab FIRPM) and thresholded, and candidate action
    potentials were sorted into clusters in principal components space (Off-line Sorter, Plexon).
  session_description: |
    This session contains raw and high-pass filtered (200 Hz) extracellular data from globus pallidus-internus (GPi)
    in parkinsonism monkeys performing a choice reaction time reaching task.
