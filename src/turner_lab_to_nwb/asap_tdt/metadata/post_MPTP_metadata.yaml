  experiment_description: |
    This dataset contains recordings of single-unit activity from from multiple cortical areas,
    including globus pallidus-internus (GPi), ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus (VLa and VLp) and
    the arm-related regions of primary motor cortex, including sulcus (M1-S) and gyrus (M1-G) subregions, in MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-induced parkinsonian monkeys performing a choice
    reaction time reaching task. Small numbers of recordings were also obtained from supplementary motor area (SMA),
    external globus pallidus (GPe), the thalamic reticular nucleus (RTN), striatum (STR) and the region between RTN
    and VL thalamus (R-V).
    The neuronal activity was recorded using 16-contact linear probes (0.5–1.0 MΩ, V-probe, Plexon) or glass-insulated
    tungsten microelectrodes (0.5–1.5 MΩ, Alpha Omega). The neuronal data were amplified (4×, 2 Hz–7.5 kHz) and
    digitized at 24.414 kHz (approx., 16-bit resolution; Tucker Davis Technologies).
    The neuronal data were high-pass filtered (Fpass: 200 Hz, Matlab FIRPM) and thresholded, and candidate action
    potentials were sorted into clusters in principal components space (Off-line Sorter, Plexon).
  session_description: |
    This session contains raw and high-pass filtered (200 Hz) extracellular data from multiple cortical areas,
    including the globus pallidus-internus (GPi) and ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus (VLa and VLp) in
    parkinsonian macaque performing a choice reaction time reaching task.
