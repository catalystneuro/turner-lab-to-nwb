### Data Streams to Convert

The conversion pipeline will handle the following data streams:

- **Extracellular electrophysiology**
    - Spike times
    - Waveforms
    - Antidromic stimulation traces

- **Behavioral task events**
    - Trial timing
    - Reach targets
    - Perturbations
    - Rewards

- **Analog kinematics**
    - Elbow joint angle

- **LFP signals**
    - Trial-based (when present)

- **EMG signals**
    - Trial-based (when present)

## Keywords
**MPTP**: 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine — A neurotoxin used to induce parkinsonism in primates by selectively destroying dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra.

**M1**: Primary Motor Cortex — The cortical area essential for generating voluntary movement, also a target of basal ganglia-thalamocortical projections.

**SNc**: Substantia Nigra pars compacta — Midbrain structure containing dopaminergic neurons; degenerates in Parkinson’s disease (documented with TH immunostaining).

**BG**: Basal Ganglia — A group of subcortical nuclei involved in motor control and strongly implicated in Parkinson’s disease pathophysiology.

**PTN**: Pyramidal Tract-type Neuron — Cortical neurons in layer 5b projecting to the spinal cord (via corticospinal tract). Strongly affected by MPTP; central to conveying motor commands.

**CSN**: Corticostriatal Neuron — Cortical intratelencephalic neurons projecting to the striatum; relatively spared in parkinsonism compared to PTNs.

**GLM**: Generalized Linear Model — Statistical model used to quantify spike-rate encoding of kinematic parameters (direction, position, speed, acceleration).

**SDF**: Spike Density Function — A continuous estimate of neuronal firing rate over time, built by convolving spike trains with a kernel.

**EMG**: Electromyography — Muscle electrical activity recordings, used to assess motor output during movements and reflexes.

**LLSR**: Long-Latency Stretch Reflex — A transcortical reflex response to muscle stretch, exaggerated in Parkinson’s disease and thought to underlie rigidity.

**RT**: Reaction Time — Delay between stimulus and initiation of movement, often prolonged after MPTP.

**MD**: Movement Duration — Time taken to complete a movement, typically lengthened in parkinsonism.

**Velmax / Acc**: Peak Velocity / Acceleration — Kinematic parameters encoded by M1 neurons and affected by MPTP.

**TH**: Tyrosine Hydroxylase — Enzyme marker for dopaminergic neurons, used in histology to confirm MPTP-induced nigral cell loss.
