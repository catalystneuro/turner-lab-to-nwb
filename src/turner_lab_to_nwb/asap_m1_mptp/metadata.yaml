  session_description: |
    Single-unit recordings from primary motor cortex (M1) of MPTP-treated parkinsonian macaque monkeys 
    performing visuomotor step-tracking flexion/extension elbow movements. Data includes spike times from 
    pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) and corticostriatal neurons (CSNs) identified through antidromic stimulation.
    Task involves center hold, target presentation, movement execution, and reward phases with optional 
    torque perturbations on random trials.

    visuomotor motor tasks. MPTP-induced parkinsonian model used to study changes in pyramidal tract 
    and corticostriatal neuron activity patterns.

  surgery: |
    Aseptic surgery under Isoflurane inhalation anesthesia. Cylindrical stainless steel recording
    chamber implanted with stereotaxic guidance over left primary motor cortex (M1) and posterior
    putamen, oriented 35° to the coronal plane. Custom floating stimulating electrodes (Teflon-coated
    PtIr microwires, 50-μm diameter) implanted in posterior putamen (3 electrodes) and prepontine
    cerebral peduncle (1 electrode) for antidromic identification of corticostriatal neurons and
    pyramidal tract neurons. Prophylactic antibiotics and analgesics administered perioperatively.
  pharmacology: |
    MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) administered at 0.5 mg/kg via unilateral
    left internal carotid artery under general anesthesia to induce hemiparkinsonian syndrome.
    Post-MPTP recordings obtained >30 days following MPTP administration (range: 36-117 days).
    Stereological analysis confirmed 67% loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons in substantia
    nigra pars compacta of MPTP-treated hemisphere, with contralateral hemisphere showing normal
    dopaminergic neuron counts.
