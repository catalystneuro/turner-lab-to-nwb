  session_description: |
    Single-unit recordings from primary motor cortex (M1) of MPTP-treated parkinsonian macaque monkeys 
    performing visuomotor step-tracking flexion/extension elbow movements. Data includes spike times from 
    pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) and corticostriatal neurons (CSNs) identified through antidromic stimulation.
    Task involves center hold, target presentation, movement execution, and reward phases with optional 
    torque perturbations on random trials.
