# Experimental Setup Commonalities Across MPTP Studies

## Common Elements

### Animal Model and MPTP Treatment
- All three studies used macaque monkeys as subjects
- MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) administered to induce parkinsonian symptoms
- Bilateral MPTP treatment protocol across studies
- Similar timeline for post-MPTP behavioral and electrophysiological assessments

### Recording Methods
- Single-unit extracellular recordings from primary motor cortex (M1)
- Use of microelectrodes for neuronal activity monitoring
- Pre- and post-MPTP comparison design in all studies
- Focus on layer V neurons in primary motor cortex

### Cell Type Identification
- Antidromic identification techniques used to distinguish neuron types
- Pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) identified via antidromic activation from pyramidal tract
- Corticostriatal neurons (CSNs) identified via antidromic activation from striatum
- Consistent criteria for cell type classification across studies

### Data Analysis Approaches
- Statistical comparison of pre- vs post-MPTP conditions
- Population-level analysis of neuronal responses
- Use of similar statistical methods for significance testing

## Key Differences

### Experimental Paradigms

#### Muscle Stretch Study
- **Task**: Passive muscle stretch protocols
- **Focus**: Proprioceptive responses and stretch reflexes
- **Measurements**: Response latencies, directional selectivity during passive limb manipulation
- **Specific Methods**: Long-latency stretch reflex (LLSR) analysis

#### Pyramidal Tract Neurons Study
- **Task**: Spontaneous activity recording during rest
- **Focus**: Baseline firing rate changes
- **Measurements**: Spontaneous firing rates without specific behavioral tasks
- **Specific Methods**: Long-term monitoring of resting state activity

#### Active Movement Study
- **Task**: Center-out reaching movements
- **Focus**: Active movement encoding and kinematics
- **Measurements**: Movement-related neural activity, kinematic parameter encoding
- **Specific Methods**: Generalized Linear Models (GLM) for kinematic encoding analysis

### Analysis Techniques

#### Muscle Stretch Study
- Emphasis on temporal dynamics and response latencies
- Directional tuning analysis during stretch responses
- Reflex pathway characterization

#### Pyramidal Tract Neurons Study
- Simple firing rate comparisons
- Cell-type specific vulnerability assessment
- Baseline activity quantification

#### Active Movement Study
- Complex kinematic modeling using GLM
- Movement parameter decoding analysis
- Population vector algorithms for movement direction prediction
- Temporal correlation analysis between neural activity and movement kinematics

### Outcome Measures

#### Muscle Stretch Study
- Response latency changes
- Directional selectivity degradation
- Stretch reflex enhancement

#### Pyramidal Tract Neurons Study
- Percentage change in firing rates (27% reduction in PTNs)
- Cell-type specific effects quantification

#### Active Movement Study
- Kinematic encoding strength (29% reduction)
- Movement-related activity levels (36% hypoactivation)
- Directional tuning precision during active movement

## Methodological Consistency
The three studies demonstrate a systematic approach to understanding MPTP effects on M1, with consistent animal models and recording techniques but complementary experimental paradigms that together provide a comprehensive view of cortical dysfunction in parkinsonism across passive responses, resting states, and active movement control.
