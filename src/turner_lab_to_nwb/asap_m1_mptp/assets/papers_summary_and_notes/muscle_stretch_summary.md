**Citation**: Pasquereau B, Turner RS (2013) Primary motor cortex of the parkinsonian monkey: altered neuronal responses to muscle stretch. *Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience* 7:98.

## Overview

This study investigated how MPTP-induced parkinsonism affects neuronal responses to muscle stretch in primary motor cortex (M1), with particular focus on the transcortical component of the long-latency stretch reflex (LLSR). The research revealed a surprising dissociation: while behavioral LLSR is exaggerated in parkinsonism, cortical (M1) stretch responses were not enhanced, suggesting that the exaggerated reflex is mediated primarily at the spinal cord level rather than through transcortical pathways.

## Introduction and Context

### Muscle Rigidity in Parkinson's Disease

Muscle rigidity is a cardinal feature of Parkinson's disease, characterized by:
- Increased resistance to passive limb movement
- Velocity-independent stiffness (unlike spasticity)
- "Lead-pipe" or "cogwheel" quality
- Contribution to disability and discomfort

### Long-Latency Stretch Reflex (LLSR)

The LLSR is a polysynaptic reflex response to muscle stretch occurring 50-100 ms after stretch onset:
- **Short-latency component (M1)**: Spinal reflex (~20-30 ms latency)
- **Long-latency component (M2/M3)**: Involves supraspinal pathways including M1 (~50-100 ms)
- **Transcortical loop**: Muscle spindle afferents project to M1 via thalamus; M1 output returns via corticospinal tract

### Study Rationale

The LLSR is exaggerated in Parkinson's disease, contributing to rigidity. Two potential mechanisms:
1. **Enhanced transcortical pathway**: Increased M1 responsiveness to proprioceptive input
2. **Enhanced spinal pathway**: Increased spinal reflex gain independent of cortex

This study directly tested whether M1 neurons show enhanced responses to muscle stretch in parkinsonism.

## Animals and MPTP Treatment

### Subjects
- Two female rhesus macaques (*Macaca mulatta*)
- **Monkey V**: 4.8 kg body weight
- **Monkey L**: 6.0 kg body weight
- Same subjects used across all three papers in the series

### MPTP Administration Protocol
- **Method**: Unilateral intracarotid injection
- **Dose**: 0.5 mg/kg MPTP-HCl dissolved in saline
- **Injection Site**: Left internal carotid artery
- **Effect**: Selective dopaminergic denervation of right hemisphere

### Parkinsonian Features Relevant to This Study
- Clear muscle rigidity on clinical examination
- Exaggerated long-latency stretch reflexes
- Stable parkinsonian symptoms throughout recording period

## Neuron Types and Identification

### Pyramidal Tract Neurons (PTNs)
- **Identification**: Antidromic activation from cerebral peduncle
- **Antidromic Latency**: 0.6-2.5 ms
- **Relevance**: Direct output to spinal cord; mediates transcortical component of LLSR

### Corticostriatal Neurons (CSNs)
- **Identification**: Antidromic activation from posterolateral putamen
- **Antidromic Latency**: 2.0-20 ms
- **Relevance**: Projects to basal ganglia; may modulate cortical stretch responses

### Antidromic Identification Criteria
Standard three criteria applied:
1. Fixed latency responses
2. High-frequency following (>200 Hz)
3. Collision test confirmation

## Experimental Protocol

### Passive Muscle Stretch Paradigm

Unlike the active movement task used in the other papers, this study used **passive** imposed perturbations:

1. **Rest Position**
   - Monkey's arm positioned in manipulandum
   - Arm relaxed, no active holding required
   - EMG monitored to verify muscle relaxation

2. **Perturbation Delivery**
   - Torque motor applied rapid step displacements
   - Perturbation directions: Flexion and extension
   - Perturbation amplitudes: Multiple magnitudes tested
   - Velocity: Rapid enough to elicit stretch reflexes

3. **Response Recording**
   - Single-unit M1 activity recorded throughout
   - EMG from forearm muscles recorded simultaneously
   - Kinematic data (position, velocity) recorded

### Perturbation Parameters
- **Direction**: Flexion (stretching extensors) or Extension (stretching flexors)
- **Amplitude**: Graded magnitudes to assess response scaling
- **Timing**: Unpredictable onset to prevent anticipatory responses
- **Duration**: Brief step perturbations

### Data Alignment
- All neural and behavioral data aligned to perturbation onset
- Peri-perturbation time histograms (PPTH) constructed
- Analysis windows defined for different reflex components

## Data Collection

### Neuron Sample Sizes

| Condition | PTNs | CSNs | Total |
|-----------|------|------|-------|
| Pre-MPTP  | 68   | 52   | 120   |
| Post-MPTP | 47   | 38   | 85    |
| **Total** | **115** | **90** | **205** |

### Recording Sessions
- Multiple sessions per condition
- Same recording methods as other papers
- Glass-coated tungsten microelectrodes
- Chronic recording chamber over M1

## Analysis Methods

### Neural Response Characterization

#### Response Latency
- Time from perturbation onset to significant neural response
- Defined as deviation from baseline exceeding statistical threshold
- Critical for determining reflex pathway involvement

#### Response Magnitude
- Change in firing rate from baseline
- Quantified as peak response amplitude
- Also measured as area under response curve (integrated response)

#### Directional Selectivity
- Comparison of responses to flexion vs extension perturbations
- Direction Index: (Preferred - Non-preferred) / (Preferred + Non-preferred)
- Important for assessing information specificity

### Reflex Component Timing
- **Short-latency (M1)**: 20-45 ms (spinal reflex)
- **Long-latency (M2)**: 45-75 ms (early transcortical)
- **Long-latency (M3)**: 75-100 ms (late transcortical/volitional)

### Statistical Methods
- Comparison of response distributions (pre vs post MPTP)
- Analysis of latency distributions
- Directional selectivity comparisons
- Bootstrap and permutation tests

## Key Findings

### Behavioral LLSR is Exaggerated

EMG recordings confirmed:
- **Enhanced long-latency EMG responses** post-MPTP
- Increased reflex gain (response magnitude relative to stretch amplitude)
- Consistent with clinical rigidity
- Replicates findings in human Parkinson's disease patients

### M1 Neural Responses NOT Enhanced

Contrary to the hypothesis of enhanced transcortical transmission:

#### Response Magnitude
- **No increase** in M1 response amplitude post-MPTP
- PTN responses: Unchanged or slightly reduced
- CSN responses: No significant change
- Applies to both early and late response components

#### Response Latency
- **Shortened latencies** post-MPTP in some neurons
- Earlier onset of stretch-evoked responses
- However, this did not translate to enhanced responses

### Degraded Directional Selectivity

Post-MPTP neurons showed:
- **Reduced directional tuning** for stretch direction
- Less distinction between flexion and extension responses
- Compromised ability to encode perturbation direction
- Similar to directional selectivity loss during active movement

### Summary of Neural Changes

| Measure | Expected (if transcortical) | Actual Finding |
|---------|---------------------------|----------------|
| Response magnitude | Increased | **No change / slight decrease** |
| Response latency | Decreased | Decreased |
| Directional selectivity | Preserved/enhanced | **Degraded** |
| Response probability | Increased | No change |

### Cell-Type Specific Effects

#### PTNs
- Stretch response magnitude unchanged
- Latency shortening most evident
- Directional selectivity degraded
- Baseline firing rate reduced (consistent with spontaneous activity findings)

#### CSNs
- Similar pattern to PTNs but less pronounced
- Stretch responses relatively preserved
- Directional selectivity maintained better than PTNs

## Interpretation

### Spinal vs. Transcortical Mechanisms

The dissociation between exaggerated behavioral LLSR and unchanged/reduced cortical responses suggests:

1. **Enhanced spinal gain**: The exaggerated LLSR in parkinsonism is primarily mediated by increased spinal reflex excitability, not enhanced transcortical transmission

2. **Cortical contribution minimal**: M1 does not show the hyperresponsiveness that would be expected if it were driving the exaggerated reflexes

3. **Possible disinhibition at spinal level**: Dopamine depletion effects on descending modulatory pathways may release spinal reflexes from inhibition

### Integration with Other Findings

The results are consistent with:
- **PTN hypoactivity** (spontaneous activity paper): Reduced cortical drive may impair normal suppression of spinal reflexes
- **Movement encoding deficits** (active movement paper): Degraded proprioceptive processing fits the pattern of compromised M1 function
- **Beta rhythmicity**: Abnormal oscillations may interfere with normal stretch response processing

### Mechanistic Model

```
Normal State:
Muscle stretch → Spinal reflex (M1) → LLSR response
                → Transcortical (M2/M3) → Modulates total response
                + Descending inhibition from M1 → Keeps spinal gain in check

Parkinsonian State:
Muscle stretch → Spinal reflex (M1) → ENHANCED (disinhibited)
                → Transcortical → NORMAL/REDUCED
                - Reduced descending inhibition → Spinal gain increases
```

## Clinical Relevance

### Understanding Rigidity Mechanisms

1. **Rigidity is not simply cortical hyperactivity**: The transcortical loop is not hyperactive
2. **Spinal mechanisms are primary**: Therapeutic targets may be at spinal level
3. **Cortical dysfunction is complex**: M1 shows reduced function despite enhanced peripheral reflexes

### Therapeutic Implications

- **L-DOPA effects on rigidity**: May work partly through spinal mechanisms
- **Spinal interventions**: Intrathecal approaches could target exaggerated reflexes
- **Cortical stimulation**: May not directly address rigidity mechanisms

### Relationship to Other Motor Symptoms

| Symptom | Proposed Mechanism |
|---------|-------------------|
| Rigidity | Enhanced spinal reflexes + reduced cortical suppression |
| Bradykinesia | PTN hypoactivity + reduced kinematic encoding |
| Tremor | Abnormal oscillatory activity in basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops |

## Significance

This research demonstrates that parkinsonian rigidity involves a complex dissociation between peripheral (behavioral) and central (cortical) stretch responses:

1. **Exaggerated LLSR is primarily spinal**: Not driven by enhanced M1 responsiveness
2. **M1 stretch processing is degraded**: Reduced directional selectivity and unchanged magnitude
3. **PTN hypoactivity may contribute**: Reduced cortical output may disinhibit spinal reflexes
4. **Cell-type differences persist**: PTNs show more pronounced changes than CSNs

These findings complement the understanding of cortical dysfunction in parkinsonism by showing that M1 abnormalities extend to passive proprioceptive processing, not just active movement control. The dissociation between enhanced behavioral reflexes and unchanged cortical responses provides important insights into the circuit-level mechanisms of parkinsonian rigidity.
