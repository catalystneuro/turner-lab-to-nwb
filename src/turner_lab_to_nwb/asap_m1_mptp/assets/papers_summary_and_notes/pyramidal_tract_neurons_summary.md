# Primary Motor Cortex of the Parkinsonian Monkey: Pyramidal Tract Neurons

## Overview
This study examined the differential effects of MPTP-induced parkinsonism on spontaneous activity of pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) and corticostriatal neurons (CSNs) in the primary motor cortex.

## Key Findings

### Differential Effects on Neuron Types
- PTN firing rates reduced by 27% after MPTP treatment
- CSN firing rates remained unchanged
- Selective vulnerability of pyramidal tract pathway

### Spontaneous Activity Changes
- Significant hypoactivity in PTNs during rest
- Preserved activity levels in corticostriatal pathway
- Cell-type specific responses to parkinsonian pathology

### Functional Implications
- Compromised cortical output to spinal motor circuits
- Preserved cortico-basal ganglia communication
- Contribution to bradykinesia and reduced movement initiation

## Methods
- Antidromic identification of PTNs and CSNs
- Long-term recordings of spontaneous firing rates
- Pre- and post-MPTP comparisons

## Significance
This research reveals that parkinsonian pathology affects cortical neurons in a cell-type specific manner, with pyramidal tract neurons showing particular vulnerability. This selective impairment may contribute to the characteristic motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease by disrupting direct cortical control of spinal motor circuits.
