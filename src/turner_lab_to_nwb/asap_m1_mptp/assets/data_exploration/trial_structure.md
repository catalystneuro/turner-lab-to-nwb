# Trial Structure and Timing Analysis

## Overview

The Turner Lab MPTP dataset presents an important design decision regarding how to define trial boundaries for NWB conversion. The MATLAB data files contain trial-segmented data where all timing information (events, spikes, analog signals) is relative to individual trial starts. This document analyzes different approaches for defining `start_time` and `stop_time` for trials in the NWB format.

## Data Structure Context

### Trial-Relative Timing
All data in the MATLAB files is stored relative to individual trial starts:
- **Event times**: Stored in milliseconds relative to trial start (e.g., home_cue=2199ms, reward=8177ms)
- **Spike times**: Stored in milliseconds relative to trial start
- **Analog data**: Stored as separate arrays per trial (e.g., `Analog.x[trial_idx]`)
- **Movement parameters**: Extracted kinematics relative to trial start

### Typical Trial Timeline
Based on analysis of multiple files (v0502, v3601, v0601):
```
Trial Start (0ms)
    |
    ├── Home Cue (1439-4096ms): Visual cue for center hold position
    |
    ├── Target Cue (4796-8037ms): Peripheral target presentation  
    |
    ├── Movement Onset (5026-8334ms): Subject leaves home position
    |
    ├── Reward Delivery (5699-9343ms): Liquid reward for successful trial
    |
    ├── Perturbations (when present):
    |   ├── Flexion Torque (tq_flex, 3135-5417ms): Applied during movement phase
    |   └── Extension Torque (tq_ext, 3281-4431ms): Applied during movement phase
    |
    ├── Movement Parameters (Mvt structure):
    |   ├── Movement Onset Time (onset_t, 4970-8271ms): Extracted movement start
    |   ├── Movement End Time (end_t, 5335-8522ms): Extracted movement completion
    |   ├── Peak Velocity Time (pkvel_t, 5115-8415ms): Time of maximum velocity
    |   ├── Peak Velocity (pkvel): Maximum velocity value (scalar)
    |   ├── Movement Amplitude (mvt_amp): Total movement distance (scalar)
    |   └── End Position (end_posn): Final joint angle (scalar)
    |
    ├── Analog Data Streams (0-10288ms, 1kHz sampling):
    |   ├── Position (x): Elbow joint angle throughout trial
    |   ├── Velocity (vel): Angular velocity (derived from position)
    |   ├── Torque (torq): Motor torque commands
    |   ├── EMG (emg): Muscle activity (5-6 channels, when collected)
    |   └── LFP (lfp): Local field potentials (when collected)
    |
    ├── Spike Times (unit_ts, 0-10288ms):
    |   ├── 2D format: Multiple spikes per trial (trials × max_spikes)
    |   └── 1D format: Single spike per trial (some sessions)
    |
    └── Analog Recording End (6406-10288ms): Full neural/behavioral data
```

### Key Timing Statistics
- **Home cue to target**: ~4100ms (SD: 600ms)
- **Target to movement**: ~300ms (SD: 150ms)  
- **Movement to reward**: ~950ms (SD: 170ms)
- **Analog recording duration**: 6.4-10.1s per trial
- **Data beyond reward**: ~700ms average

## Trial Boundary Options

### Option 1: Event-Based Boundaries (0 to reward + 1.0s)

**Definition**: 
- `start_time = 0` (relative to trial recording start)
- `stop_time = reward_time + 1.0s`

**Rationale**:
- Reward marks behavioral task completion
- 1-second buffer captures post-reward neural responses
- Consistent with typical motor control study conventions
- Aligns with task structure described in published papers

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Contains all behavioral events
- ✅ Contains all analog data (verified across test files)
- ✅ Contains all spike data  
- ✅ Biologically meaningful endpoints
- ✅ Consistent trial durations (7.3-10.3s)

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ May truncate very late neural activity
- ❌ Fixed buffer may not suit all trial types

**Implementation**:
```python
trial_start = cumulative_time
trial_stop = cumulative_time + reward_time/1000 + 1.0
cumulative_time = trial_stop + inter_trial_interval
```

### Option 2: Analog-Based Boundaries (0 to analog_end)

**Definition**:
- `start_time = 0`
- `stop_time = len(Analog.x[trial]) / 1000.0` (full analog duration)

**Rationale**:
- Uses natural recording boundaries
- Preserves all recorded data
- No assumptions about relevant time windows
- Matches actual data collection parameters

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Guaranteed to contain ALL recorded data
- ✅ No data truncation
- ✅ Preserves late neural responses
- ✅ True to original recording structure
- ✅ Variable trial lengths reflect actual experimental conditions

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ May include irrelevant post-task activity
- ❌ Slightly larger file sizes

**Implementation**:
```python
trial_start = cumulative_time
trial_stop = cumulative_time + len(analog_data[trial]) / 1000.0
cumulative_time = trial_stop + inter_trial_interval
```

### Option 3: Home Cue to Reward + Buffer

**Definition**:
- `start_time = home_cue_time` (first behavioral event)
- `stop_time = reward_time + 0.5s`

**Rationale**:
- Trial starts with first task-relevant event
- Minimal pre-task baseline included
- Focuses on behaviorally relevant period
- Reduces data storage for pre-task periods

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Tightly aligned with task execution
- ✅ Minimal irrelevant data
- ✅ Clear behavioral anchoring
- ✅ Smaller file sizes

**Disadvantages**:
- ❌ Loses pre-cue baseline activity
- ❌ May miss preparatory neural signals
- ❌ Incompatible with some baseline correction methods
- ❌ Doesn't contain full analog recordings

**Implementation**:
```python
trial_start = cumulative_time
trial_stop = cumulative_time + (reward_time - home_cue_time)/1000 + 0.5
cumulative_time = trial_stop + inter_trial_interval
```

## Analysis Results

### Data Containment Testing

Testing across three representative files (v0502.1.mat, v3601.1.mat, v0601.1.mat):

| Approach | Events | Analog | Spikes | Consistency |
|----------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| 0 to reward+1.0s | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% | High |
| 0 to analog_end | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% | ✅ 100% | High |
| home_cue to reward+0.5s | ✅ 100% | ❌ 60% | ❌ 70% | Medium |

### Trial Duration Distribution

| Approach | Min | Max | Mean | StdDev |
|----------|-----|-----|------|--------|
| Event-based (0 to reward+1s) | 7.3s | 10.3s | 8.3s | 0.8s |
| Analog-based | 6.4s | 10.1s | 8.0s | 1.0s |
| Home cue to reward+0.5s | 4.4s | 6.7s | 5.9s | 0.6s |

## Inter-Trial Intervals

The `inter_trial_time_interval` parameter (default: 3.0s) represents the gap between trials, not trial duration. This creates a continuous timeline where:

```
Trial 0: [0, stop_0]
Gap: [stop_0, stop_0 + 3.0]
Trial 1: [stop_0 + 3.0, stop_1]
Gap: [stop_1, stop_1 + 3.0]
Trial 2: [stop_1 + 3.0, stop_2]
...
```

## Recommendation for Discussion

**Primary recommendation**: **Option 1 (Event-based: 0 to reward + 1.0s)**

This approach balances biological significance with data completeness. It:
- Aligns with experimental design (reward marks trial completion)
- Contains all recorded data based on testing
- Provides consistent, meaningful boundaries
- Follows conventions in motor neuroscience literature

**Alternative for consideration**: **Option 2 (Analog-based)**

If preserving every millisecond of recorded data is critical, using analog boundaries ensures no data loss while maintaining the natural structure of the recordings. Variable trial lengths are not problematic and actually reflect the true experimental conditions.

## Questions for Data Authors

1. **Biological significance**: Is there important neural activity beyond reward + 1.0s that should be preserved?

2. **Task design**: Were trials intentionally recorded for specific durations, or did recording stop naturally after task completion?

3. **Inter-trial intervals**: Is the 3.0s default inter-trial interval accurate for the experimental protocol?

4. **Pre-cue activity**: Is the pre-home-cue period (0 to ~2s) scientifically important for baseline or preparatory activity analysis?

5. **Data completeness priority**: Should we prioritize preserving all recorded data (Option 2) or focus on behaviorally relevant periods (Option 1)?

## Implementation Notes

The chosen approach will affect:
- Total NWB file size
- Memory requirements for analysis
- Compatibility with analysis pipelines
- Interpretability of neural dynamics

The conversion pipeline should document which approach was used and provide rationale for future users of the dataset.
